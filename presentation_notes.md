## Why

Commercial casting directors rely on a network of agents to help them find actors to audition for parts. But theatre directors do not have this network. They are always trying to find more actors to audition for parts. Meanwhile, actors have no way to reach these directors other than to submit headshots. Headshots are very expensive for actors to print and cumbersome for directors to organize.

The mission of Audition City is to facilitate the actor-director relationship in the auditioning process.

## Current Version

- Actors can post detailed profiles, including resum√©s and headshots
- Actors can also be Directors, and vice versa
- Directors can search Actor profiles to find actors that fit a specific character type
- Directors can contact Actors to invite Actors to audition
- Directors can take personal notes on any actor and mark actors for a Callback

## For Future Versions

- Facilitate a community-wide "Unified" audition process
- Directors can post audition opportunities
